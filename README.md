# Android Assets for Photoshop


A Photoshop script for exporting assets for Android projects.

The script works by duplicating the selected layer (or layergroup) to a new document, then scaling it to each of the 5 most common Android sizes (XXXHDPI, XXHDPI, XHDPI, HDPI, and MDPI) and then placing the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

## Installation
1. Download the script here

2. Move the **.jsx** file to your Photoshop scripts folder:

	- Mac: **/Applications/Adobe Photoshop.../Presets/Scripts/**
	- PC 64bit: **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop... (64 Bit)\Presets\Scripts\**
	- PC 32bit: **C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop...\Presets\Scripts\**

3. Add **@** or **#** to layer name to export image:

	- @ for PNG
	- # for JPEG


## Version Explanation
The normal version is unchanged from its origin (Uncorked Studios).

The extended version was customized with configuration screen and some tweaks to improve export time.

Feel free to use and fix any bugs in this script.
